			<h1>Introduction and Acceptance of the Terms and Conditions</h1>

			The general Terms and Conditions of Sale detailed below govern the
			contractual relationship between the ‘User’ (hereafter also referred
			to as ‘You’ or the ‘Customer’) and ‘Shopp-E’ (hereafter also referred
			to as ‘We’ or the ‘Website’), belonging to the Shopp-E Shopp-E Name,
			Shopp-E number Shopp-E Number, VAT no Shopp-E VAT. Both parties
			accept these Conditions unreservedly. These general Conditions of
			Sale are the only conditions that are applicable and replace all
			other conditions, except in the case of express. written, prior
			dispensation. We maintain that, by confirming your order, you have
			read and do unreservedly accept our general Conditions of Sale. These
			Terms and Conditions of Sale are important to you and Shopp-E as they
			are used to protect your rights as a valued customer and our rights
			as a business. Changes to the Terms of Service and the Website

			Shopp-E is a work in progress, and as such things may change, be
			added or be taken away. We reserve the right to update the Website
			and these Terms of Service from time to time, at our discretion and
			without any notice. It is solely your responsibility to keep
			up-to-date with the latest Terms and Conditions by checking back
			regularly. Your continued use of the Website following the publishing
			of updated Terms of Service will be taken to mean that you have read
			and agree to the changes. <br>
			<br>
			<h4>Access to the Website</h4>

			We work hard to ensure the Website is always up and available, but we
			can't guarantee that the Website will not have downtime for any
			reason. We reserve the right to close the Website for short periods
			of time for general maintenance, but will attempt to keep this to a
			minimum. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of
			the Website is unavailable at any time, for any length of time. Parts
			of the Website require you to input a password to access certain
			features. This is to be able to give you details relevant to your
			order whilst still keeping them private to you. To do this, as part
			of our security procedures, we require you to register an account
			with Shopp-E by entering your email and choosing a secure password.
			We highly recommend that you choose a strong password that is hard
			for others to guess, and you log out from your account at the end of
			every session. There is a password reset procedure in case you forget
			your password. You must treat your account log-in information as
			confidential, not disclosing it to any third party and only using
			Shopp-E in person. If you think there may have been any breach of
			security then it is your responsibility to notify us immediately and
			if log-in is possible, to change your password. It is a condition of
			your use of the Website that all the information you provide on the
			Website is correct, current and complete. We reserve the right to
			disable any user account in our sole discretion, at any time for any
			or no reason, including if, in our opinion, you have failed to comply
			with any provision of these Terms of Service. We do not guarantee
			that the Website or any content provided on the Website is error
			free. We manage your personal data according to our Privacy Policy. <br>
			<br>
			<h4>Product information</h4>

			Shopp-E takes great care when putting product information,
			descriptions and images on-line but will not be held responsible for
			any mistakes or omissions to any information given. <br>
			<br>
			<h4>Prices</h4>

			The prices indicated on Shopp-E are shown in Pound Sterling and do
			not include delivery. The delivery costs are clearly shown and
			invoiced at the end of the order in addition to the price of the
			products. We reserve the right to modify our prices at any moment but
			this will be indicated to you on the order at the time the order is
			placed. If an obviously incorrect price appears on our website and is
			not corrected on your total at the time of order completion, for
			whatever reason (human error, technical error etc.), your order will
			be cancelled and the payment refunded to you, even if it has been
			initially validated. <br>
			<br>
			<h4>Availability</h4>

			We will always endeavour to fulfil your order once completed and paid
			for. If a product should become unavailable after your order has been
			confirmed and paid for, we will refund the price you paid for the
			product within 30 days following the date of payment. If your order
			includes products that are temporarily unavailable, we will send the
			available products out first and will follow with the outstanding
			items once they are available again. We will refund the shipping fees
			for the rest of the order. If relevant, we will offer you a
			replacement for an unavailable product, a product of equal price and
			quality. If you accept the replacement, and then wish to return it to
			us in the conditions outlined under Right of Return, the return
			postage will be covered by us. If you choose to decline this offer,
			and the original product is permanently unavailable, we will
			reimburse the price of the unavailable product. <br>
			<br>
			<h4>Feedback & Comments</h4>

			Any opinions left on the Website by Shopp-E customers are screened
			and moderated by Shopp-E . If the comments infringe on the law or are
			inappropriate (abusive publicity, defamation, insults, out of context
			commentary…), Shopp-E reserves the right to refuse or modify it.
